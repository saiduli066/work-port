# Header component #

In this component, I have added a navbar which is consist of name and some nav links and a button.This is a responsive navbar for mobile and laptop.

# Home components #-->
This component renders a banner section with an image and some text, a section displaying job categories with icons and the number of available jobs for each category, and a featured jobs section where a maximum of four jobs are displayed. If the user clicks on the "See All" button, all available jobs will be displayed instead.

The component also has some functionality using the useState hook. It sets the initial state of the "showAllJobs" variable to false. When the user clicks the "See All" button, it updates the state to true and displays all jobs.

Finally, the code uses some React Router functionality, such as the Link component, to navigate to different pages based on the user's interaction with the page.

This component displays some questions and answers related to React concepts.The questions are related to different React concepts such as Context API, custom hooks, useRef, and useMemo, and the answers explain these concepts in detail.

# Statistics component #
-->
This component uses the Recharts library to render a chart displaying the marks I obtained in previous assignments. The chart is a ComposedChart, which combines a Bar and a Line chart. The XAxis shows the name of each assignment, and the YAxis shows the corresponding mark. The Bar chart is colored in blue, while the Line chart is colored in orange. The component uses ResponsiveContainer to make the chart responsive and fit to the width of its container. The data used to generate the chart is an array of objects, where each object represents an assignment and its mark.
